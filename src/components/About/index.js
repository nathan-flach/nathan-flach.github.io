            <h3>about</h3>
            <p>Currently I’m pursuing a MSc in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in a joint program with <a href="https://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/studium/ct/human-computer-interaction-joint-master" target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">the University of Salzburg and FH Salzburg</a>. My interests lie in speculative design, tangible interaction, and (ux) design research for good.<br /><br />I come from Toronto, Canada where I received my Bachelors with Dean’s Honours from the University of Waterloo. I majored in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Knowledge Integration</a> (with a collaborative design specialisation) and minored in <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">Computer Science</a>. This hybrid degree taught me how to work in collaborative teams to solve complex problems using design thinking principles. We were taught to synthesise information, think laterally and of whole systems, and communicate and collaborate with individuals across domains. I also had five internships during this time.<br /><br />In my spare time, you can find me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80352030-nathan-flach" target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">reading</a>, listening to music, bingeing Criterion movies, or running. During my Bachelors I was a USPORTS All-Canadian in tennis, <a href='https://worldathletics.org/athletes/canada/nathan-flach-14832038' target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">track and field</a>, and cross-country – but right now I’m just running for fun :)</p>
